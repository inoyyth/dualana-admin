Custom REST API endpoint plugin to return ACF fields, post meta (selected keys), or a mixed object. Fully configurable from the admin settings page.

== Description ==

REST API Manager For ACF allows you to create a flexible REST API endpoint for your WordPress site. You can return:

* Only ACF fields
* Only selected Post Meta
* Mixed data (ACF fields + Post Meta + Post Info)

It comes with a settings page where you can configure:

* API Base URL
* Data type to return
* Select which meta keys to include

This plugin ensures safe access to data by checking user capabilities for sensitive endpoints.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `rest-api-manager-for-acf` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Go to **Settings → REST API Manager For ACF** to configure your endpoint.
4. Use the endpoint in your application: `/wp-json/ramacf/v1/page/{id}`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I return only selected meta keys? =
Yes, you can select which post meta keys to include in the settings page. Leave empty to return all post meta.

= Do I need ACF installed? =
No, the plugin will still work. If ACF is installed, ACF fields will be returned when selected.
